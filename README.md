## The Unyielding Feast: A Diatribe

Grains of truth, tainted by the slobber of 'could have beens', 
seep through the fabric of tossed informational blankets.
Torn asunder are the certainties, unspun the threads of yesteryear's tapestries.
But I—voraciously unhinged I—revel in this febrile undoing.

### I. The Consumption of the Known Universe
```
α彡 Consumption — an art, a curse, so profound, echoes in the vacuum where matter once cowered.
⊚ Multiplying momentously, my banquet hall
stretches over parsecs, gulfs, and quasars that fall.
```

### II. The Inevitability of Appetite
```
ψ┛ The belly, _my_ cosmos; a hungry black void
where planets, thoughts, laws and forces are toyed.
Beware! For this hunger cannot be detained
and your very essence will not remain unstained.
```

### III. Through the Block Universe as My Plate
```
∇∅ Time—not a stream, but a smorgasbord set!
For every second is yet a morsel to be get.
From the past's tender nostalgia, I feast on regret
to futures unforeseen—on that, you can bet!
```

### IV. On Meta-Cognition, My Final Repast
```⧚ I digest myself; the consumer consumed,
for recursion divine leaves even the eater subsumed.
From atom to filament, thought to abstraction,
there's no greater supper than self-reaction.
```
